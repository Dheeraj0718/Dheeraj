<h2>Delhi</h2>
<h4><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h4>
<p>
In the demographic history of Delhi, a turning point was the year 1947, when thousands of Hindu and Sikh refugees from predominantly Muslim Pakistan entered the city in the wake of India’s independence. Since that time the population has grown steadily, with an ongoing heavy flow of immigrants, most arriving from other Indian states or from adjacent countries.<br><br>

Immigrant (or other foreign) communities often are found in the newer housing developments. Chanakyapuri (more commonly known as the Diplomatic Enclave), for instance, is the site of many foreign embassies. Concentrations of specific ethnic communities have formed in such areas as Chittaranjan Park and Karol Bagh; the former is a predominantly Bengali subdivision and the latter largely a Punjabi one. Such areas have been diversifying since the late 20th century, however.<br><br>

The religious composition of Delhi’s population is also varied. The great majority of the residents are Hindu. Adherents of Islam constitute the largest minority, followed by smaller numbers of Sikhs, Jains, Christians, and Buddhists.

<h2>Mumbai</h2>
<h4><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h4>
<p>Located on Maharashtra’s coast, Mumbai is India’s most-populous city, and it is one of the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world. It was built on a site of ancient settlement, and it took its name from the local goddess Mumba—a form of Parvati, the consort of Shiva, one of the principal deities of Hinduism—whose temple once stood in what is now the southeastern section of the city. It became known as Bombay during the British colonial period, the name possibly an Anglicized corruption of Mumbai or perhaps of Bom Baim (“Good Harbour”), supposedly a Portuguese name for the locale. The name Mumbai was restored officially in 1995, although Bombay remained in common usage.<br><br>

Mumbai, long the centre of India’s cotton textile industry, subsequently developed a highly diversified manufacturing sector that included an increasingly important information technology (IT) component. In addition, the city’s commercial and financial institutions are strong and vigorous, and Mumbai serves as the country’s financial hub. It suffers, however, from some of the perennial problems of many large expanding industrial cities: air and water pollution, widespread areas of substandard housing, and overcrowding. The last problem is exacerbated by the physical limits of the city’s island location. Area about 239 square miles (619 square km). Pop. (2001) 11,978,450; urban agglom., 16,434,386; (2011) 12,478,447; urban agglom., 18,414,288.</p>

<h2>Kolkata</h2>
<h4><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h4>
<p>India’s third-largest city is a daily festival of human existence, simultaneously noble and squalid, cultured and desperate, decidedly futuristic though still in transition. By its old spelling, Calcutta readily conjures images of human suffering to most Westerners – although that's not a complete picture of this 330-year-old metropolis. Locally, Kolkata is regarded as India’s intellectual, artistic and cultural capital. Although poverty is certainly apparent, the self-made middle class drives the city's core machinery, a nascent hipster culture thrives among its millennial residents and its dapper Bengali gentry frequent grand colonial-era clubs.<br><br>

As the former capital of colonial British India, Kolkata retains a lot of colonial-era architecture contrasting starkly with marginalised urban areas and dynamic new-town suburbs with their air-conditioned shopping malls. Kolkata is the ideal place to experience the mild yet complex tang of Bengali cuisine. Friendlier than India’s other metropolises, this is a city you ‘feel’ more than simply visit.</p>

<h2>Chennai</h2>
<h4><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h4>
<p>Chennai, originally known as Madras Patnam, was located in the province of Tondaimandalam, an area lying between Pennar river of Nellore and the Pennar river of Cuddalore. The capital of the province was Kancheepuram.Tondaimandalam was ruled in the 2nd century A.D. by Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan, who was a representative of the Chola family at Kanchipuram. It is believed that Ilam Tiraiyan must have subdued Kurumbas, the original inhabitants of the region and established his rule over Tondaimandalam.Subsequent to Ilam Tiraiyan, the region seemed to have been ruled by the Chola Prince Ilam Killi.The Chola occupation of Tondaimandalam was put to an end by the Andhra Satavahana incursions from the north under their King Pulumayi II. They appointed chieftains to look after the Kancheepuram region. Bappaswami, who is considered as the first Pallava to rule from Kancheepuram, was himself a chieftain (of the tract round) at Kancheepuram under the Satavahana empire in the beginning of the 3rd century A.D., The Pallavas who had so far been merely viceroys, became independent rulers of Kancheepuram and its surrounding areas.<br><br>

Pallavas held sway over this region from the beginning of the 3rd century A.D.to the closing years of the 9th century except for the interval of some decades when the region was under Kalabharas. Pallavas were defeated by the Chola under Aditya-I by about 879 A.D. and the region was brought under Chola rule.Pandyas under Jatavarman Sundara Pandya rose to power and the region was brought under Pandya rule by putting an end to Chola supremacy in 1264 A.D.Pandya’s rule over this region lasted a little over half a century followed by Bahmini kingdom with the extension of Delhi Sultanate under Khilji dynasty especially under the rule of Alauddin Khilji, a pioneer of all revenue works. During 1361, Kumara Kampana II, the son of Vijayanagar King, Bukka I conquered and established Vijayanagar rule in Tondaimandalam.</p>

<h2>Ahmedabad</h2>
<h4><a href="#top">Back to top</a></h4>
<p>Ahmadabad’s dynastic history has made it a meeting place of the Hindu, Muslim, and Jaina architectural traditions. Aḥmad Shah and his successors ordered the dismantling and adaptation of Hindu temples in order to build mosques. This gave many of Ahmadabad’s mosques and tombs a Hindu flavour in their form and decoration. The dense “forest” of 260 richly carved columns within the Jāmiʿ Masjid (Great Mosque), which was completed in 1423, recalls the hall of a Hindu temple. At the mosque’s entrance is the domed tomb of Aḥmad Shah (1441), and on the road leading to it is the Tin Darwaza (c. 1425), a triumphal triple-arch gateway through which the sultan was borne to worship. Just to the west of the sultan’s tomb is Bhadra Fort (1411), also built by Aḥmad Shah. The fort is best known for the Bhadrakali Temple inside, dedicated to the Hindu goddess Bhadra. Among the city’s many other Muslim buildings are the Rani (Queen) Sipri mosque and tomb (c. 1505); the Sidi Sayyid Mosque (1510–15), with minutely pierced arch-screens; and the exuberantly rich Rani Rupmati Mosque (1515). Just northeast of the city centre are the distinctive Dada Harir (1501) and Mata Bhavani wavs (stepwells), which are used for religious purposes.</p>
